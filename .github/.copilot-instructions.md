## Development Instructions

This project uses **Yarn** as the package manager. Here are the commands for development:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 12+ or nvm installed
- Yarn installed

### Setup and Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server (opens browser automatically)
yarn start

# Build for production
yarn build
```

### Build Output
- All build files are generated in the `/dist` folder
- Files include content hashes for cache busting
- Service worker is generated for PWA functionality

### Testing Changes
1. Make your changes to source files in `/src`
2. Run `yarn start` to see changes in development
3. Run `yarn build` to test production build
4. Check `/dist` folder for generated files

### Cache Busting
The build process automatically:
- Updates build timestamps before each build
- Generates content-based hashes for all assets
- Creates unique service worker cache IDs
- Ensures browsers load fresh content after deployment
